  - "Hello again traveler,\r"
  - This is your third challenge.
  - Now that the trash has been stopped from passing through.
  - We have to clean the water.
  - Your mission now is to create a filter that cleans water.
  - 'A tip: your craft table has a Cleaning Filter!'
  - You only need to do one to complete your work here.
  - Remember, if you create the Cleaning Filter before accepting the mission, you
    will not be counted!
  - Remember, helping the environment is cool!

    a Cleaning Filter, come back when it's ready!
